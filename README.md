# covid-infos
A website for displaying statistics about the coronavirus.

Data is taken from an external source API: <https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/json/>.
If this is not possible, then the data is taken from a local proxy server with port 3001, otherwise the data is loaded locally.
